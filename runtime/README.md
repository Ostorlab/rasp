# Runtime

The C++ runtime libraries that the packer adds to a protected app. They run the checks inside the app.

Before you change anything here, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): it lists the rules the build enforces and the ones reviewers check.

## Layout

The code is grouped the same way at every level. `util/` holds generic helpers that know nothing about RASP. Every other folder is one domain module, named after the job it does, such as `checks/`, which produces the observations. When a module has a part shared by every platform, that part is in `core/`, and its platform part is in the folder with the same name under `ios/`. Every check is platform code, so checks are only in the platform folders.

- `core/`: code shared by every platform. It uses no platform API.
  - `include/rasp/observation.h`: `Observation`, the raw fact a check reports (`signal`, `source`, `status`, `value`), and `observed`, `unsupported` and `failed`, which build one.
  - `include/rasp/util/`: generic helpers.
    - `logging.h`: `rasp::log` and `kLoggingEnabled`, the development logging that release builds leave out.
  - `src/`: the code of these headers, in the same folders.
- `ios/`: `RaspRuntime.framework`, the runtime for iOS. When the app loads it, it starts the thread that runs the checks.
  - `src/monitoring.h`: `start_monitoring`, the runtime's thread. It runs the checks, then runs them again every 60 seconds. A development build logs each observation. It runs until the process exits, and iOS suspends it while the app is in the background.
  - `src/checks/`: the iOS checks. Each one reports observations.
    - `jailbreak.h`: the jailbreak checks. `jb.fs_paths` (do known jailbreak files exist, read through access and stat), `jb.sandbox_escape` (can the app write outside its sandbox) and `jb.fork_ok` (can the app start a child process). Off a physical device every one is unsupported.
  - `src/util/logging.cpp`: the iOS backend of `rasp::log`, which writes to the system log with os_log.
- `tests/`: tests that run on a development machine, with GoogleTest. They use the same folders as the code.

## Build

CMake 4.4 or newer. The presets are in `CMakePresets.json`.

The host presets build with Clang from LLVM 23, the same release as `clang-format` and `clang-tidy`. Put its `bin` folder first in `PATH` (for example `/usr/lib/llvm-23/bin` from apt.llvm.org).

On a development machine, with the tests:

```
cd runtime
cmake --preset host
cmake --build --preset host
ctest --preset host
```

The same with AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer:

```
cd runtime
cmake --preset host-asan
cmake --build --preset host-asan
ctest --preset host-asan
```

The same with ThreadSanitizer, which finds data races. It cannot be combined with AddressSanitizer, so it has its own preset:

```
cd runtime
cmake --preset host-tsan
cmake --build --preset host-tsan
ctest --preset host-tsan
```

For an iOS device (arm64), on a Mac with Xcode:

```
cd runtime
cmake --preset ios
cmake --build --preset ios
```

The framework is written to `build/ios/ios/RaspRuntime.framework`. Its install name is `@rpath/RaspRuntime.framework/RaspRuntime`, which the packer adds to the app's load commands. The framework exports no symbols: the code runs from a constructor when the app loads it.

The framework supports iOS 12.0 and later. It doesn't use the libc++ that comes with iOS, which only supports iOS 15 and later. Instead it links a static libc++ built from LLVM 23.1.3 for the same minimum iOS version, with all its symbols hidden. That library is built once and committed under `third_party/libcxx/`, and `cmake/libcxx.cmake` checks its hash and links it. The build steps, the one-line source change it needs, and the CI job that proves the committed library matches the source are described in `third_party/libcxx/README.md`.

## Logs

Only development builds write logs. A release build writes nothing to any log, so a protected app leaves no trace of the runtime in the device's log.

The `RASP_LOGGING` option turns logging on. CMake accepts it only in a Debug build (the build type is compared without case), and only with a single-configuration generator. It refuses every other build type, an empty build type, and multi-configuration generators such as Ninja Multi-Config. On iOS, the development build writes each line to the system log with `os_log`, and the `ios-dev` preset builds it:

```
cd runtime
cmake --preset ios-dev
cmake --build --preset ios-dev
```

The framework is written to `build/ios-dev/ios/RaspRuntime.framework`. Code writes a log line with `rasp::log` (`core/include/rasp/util/logging.h`), and only inside `if constexpr (rasp::kLoggingEnabled)`. In a release build, the compiler still checks the code in that block, but it generates no code for it, so neither the call nor its text is in the framework.

## Format and check

The style is in `.clang-format` and the checks are in `.clang-tidy`.

```
cd runtime
git ls-files -z -- '*.h' '*.cpp' '*.h.in' | xargs -0 clang-format -i
cmake --preset host
run-clang-tidy -quiet -p build/host "^$PWD/(?!build/).*\.cpp$"
```

The host build doesn't compile the iOS code, so on a Mac, check it with the development build too:

```
cmake --preset ios-dev
run-clang-tidy -quiet -p build/ios-dev "^$PWD/ios/src/.*\.cpp$"
```

CI runs the format check, clang-tidy (on Linux for the shared code and the tests, and on macOS for the iOS code), the three host builds, and the iOS release and development builds (`.github/workflows/runtime.yml`). It checks that the release framework exports no symbols, and that it imports none of `exit`, `_Exit`, `quick_exit`, `signal`, `sigaction`, `sigprocmask`, `pthread_sigmask`, `setenv`, `putenv`, `unsetenv`, `setlocale` and `setrlimit`. `.clang-tidy` forbids these functions in the source, and also `abort` and `std::terminate`, which the binary check leaves out. CI also checks that the release framework imports no symbol with `_os_log` in its name and contains no `{public}` text.
